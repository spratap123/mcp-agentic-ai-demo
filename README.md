## AI-Powered Multi-Channel Processing (MCP) Agent Demo

This repository contains a demo implementation of an **Agentic AI system** designed around the concept of Multi-Channel Processing (MCP) for incident management and automated remediation.

The system features:

- A **FastAPI backend** for incident intake, AI analysis, and fix orchestration  
- Integration with **OpenAI GPT** for natural language reasoning and troubleshooting suggestions  
- A **FAISS vector database** for storing and retrieving similar past incidents to provide contextual awareness  
- A **Streamlit frontend** dashboard for submitting incidents, viewing AI-generated recommendations, and triggering remediation actions (simulated)  
- Use of `.env` for secure management of OpenAI API keys and easy environment setup  

This demo serves as a foundation for building more advanced, multi-agent AI orchestration platforms for IT Operations, Security, and Incident Response teams.
